# Arma2 After Action Review - Recording and Playing your battles.

This project have been lost in years (after dev-heaven disappeard) and just a mirculous coincedence brought it back from oblivion. I was cleaning up old computer grabage and found a rusty HDD. I plugged it in and was able to recover this.

The project was a somehow working prototype, but it need a lot of love and reworking from someone. Feel free to fork and do whatever is needed for our Arma community.

Honestly, due to personal reasons, I cannot invest much into that project. No time for Arma at the moment :(

But I brought that to you, because received a lot of interest and feedback from the community. But when I wanted to share it with the community, I realized the dev-heaven is gone with all my files. And found no backup files. So here it is.

Here are is a couple of videos from that time:
